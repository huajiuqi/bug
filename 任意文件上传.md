## code analysis
Vulnerability file：ThinkCMF-master/vendor/thinkcmf/cmf-app/src/user/controller/UeditorController.php

Found an editor function point on the site
![image-20242223652626.png](./image-20242223652626.png)

Find the image upload to capture the corresponding function to find the code file

Enter ueditorUpload("image") according to the code in the upload function and the $action value of the requested package parameter; ,
273 lines of code in the ueditorUpload function process the uploaded file and return the value to $result

The file Upload and the content returned by the return package are completed in the upload class, and the suffix of the uploaded file is mainly detected in lines 103-110

103 lines of code are

105 lines of code are
![image-20242223449314.png](./image-20242223449314.png)

This if determines whether the suffix is not in the allowed suffix and determines whether the suffix is equal to php, requires that both conditions are not satisfied, and if one of them is met, it directly returns "illegal file type".

```
if (!in_array($strFileExtension, $arrAllowedExtensions) || $strFileExtension == 'php') {  
    $this->error = "非法文件类型！";  
    return false;  
}
```
if you bypass the above if judgment, you can execute the following code to complete the file upload

Add 'php::$dada' to the upload Settings (using windows features to create a' php::$dada' suffix file will eventually create a' php' suffix file) so uploading a' php::$dada' suffix file can bypass the above filtering

Successfully bypass filtering to upload a php file

## Exploits



Change a php file containing shell code to a png suffix to bypass front-end restrictions and upload

![image-20242223556823.png](./image-20242223556823.png)




Change the png suffix to 'php::$data', send the request packet to complete the upload, and upload successfully
